module Blur
  class Script
    # The +Cache+ class enables data storing inside Blur and it scripts.
    #
    # What it does is simply store a hash, and act like it is that hash.
    #
    # When the client closes, it sends a message to all available scripts
    # and then those scripts tells the cache to save, in order to remember
    # that data and reload it at the next run.
    #
    # Cache can then save the contents of the hash to a yaml file that persists
    # in the ./cache/ directory.
    #
    # That same file is then loaded once needed again.
