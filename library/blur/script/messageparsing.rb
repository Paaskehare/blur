    # The +MessageParsing+ module is a module that gives the ability to turn a
    # script into a DSL-like framework.
    #
    # What it does is automatically test to see if a message starts with a
    # trigger, and then, if so, it sends the command-part of the message to
    # the script object itself.
    #
    # This way, the plugin-writer doesn't need to have repetetive code like
    # that in every script.
    #
    # @example
    #   Script :example do
    #     extend MessageParsing
    #
    #     def command_test user, channel, message
    #       channel.say "I hear you."
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   # And if a user were to send the message ".test my method", it would
    #   # trigger the #command_test method with the following arguments
    #   #
    #   # user    => #<Blur::Network::User … >
    #   # channel => #<Blur::Network::Channel … >
    #   # message => ".test my method"
    module MessageParsing
      # The prefix that turns it into a possible command.
      MessageTrigger = "."

      # Handle all calls to the scripts +message+ method, check to see if
      # the message containts a valid command, serialize it and pass it to
      # the script as command_name with the parameters +user+, +channel+
      # and +message+.
