Blur
====
Blur is “just” another IRC-library written in Ruby.

There are a bunch of other well-written, well-running IRC libraries made for
Ruby, but for me, they don't quite cut it as **the** library I wanted to use for
my IRC services, and thus Blur was born.

Blur's predecessor was known as Pulse. The main difference between them is
that Blur has non-blocking multi-network support.

Features
--------
  * Non-blocking (no threading)
  * Multi-network support
  * Extensible with scripts (during runtime, too)
  * SSL support (buggy as hell, though)

Documentation
-------------
If you've looked through the source code of Blur, you might've guessed I'm not
the biggest fan of documentation, I prefer self-documenting code (albeit
Blur's code can be a bit weird).

As of now, there is no documentation *whatsoever*, although I will try to provide some
sort of documentation in the near future, I can't promise anything.

Known Issues
------------
  1. When Blur is connected through a secure network it tends to block a long
     time before it starts processing some data; this can cause it to time out.
  2. There are quite a lot of name collisions in Blur: for instance, in scripts
     there is a reference to the main client, which is a class variable defined
     in that script, named `@client`.
